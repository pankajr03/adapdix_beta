Steve Kalayjian’s Professional Pattern Recognition 101 Course, a product of KnowVera, LLC (“KnowVera”), is a user based Internet electronic educational platform for professional traders. KnowVera provides education and market information regarding equity exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), index futures, index options, currencies, bond futures, bond ETFs, metal futures, metal ETFs, energy futures, and energy ETFs to its users through its web site located at www.drivewealthedu.com (the “Website”) via webinar, downloadable recorded webinars and courses, streaming commentary, instant messaging and other delivery methods (the “Services”).

Neither KnowVera, the Website, nor any of its owners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, independent contractors or affiliates (collectively, “Affiliates”) are registered as an investment advisor, broker-dealer, futures commission merchant or commodity trading advisor or are members of any self-regulatory organization, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). KnowVera and the Website are not registered as investment advisors. KnowVera and the Website rely upon the “publisher’s exclusion” from the definition of “investment advisor” as provided under Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 and corresponding state securities laws. The Website and Services are bona fide publications of general and regular circulation offering impersonalized investment-related information to users and/or prospective users (e.g., not tailored to the specific investment needs of current and/or prospective users).

You understand that the information provided by KnowVera and the Website is impersonal and is not intended to be, and should not be construed in any manner whatsoever, as personalized advice or advice tailored to the investment needs of any specific person. You further understand that the material provided by KnowVera and the Website is for general informational purposes only, and that no mention of a particular security on the Website constitutes a recommendation to buy, sell or hold that or any other security, or that any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person.

Use of information provided by KnowVera and the Website is intended for use by users who are professional traders and have a high degree of investing experience and sophistication. You acknowledge that you trade at your own risk. You understand that an investment in any security is subject to a number of risks, and that discussions of any security published on the Website will not contain a list or description of relevant risk factors. Investments in the securities markets, and especially in ETFs, futures, commodities and currencies are speculative and involve substantial risk. Among other things, investors in ETFs are exposed to market risk or volatility of the specific underlying which the ETF tracks. In unfavorable market conditions (e.g., market correction or economic crisis) where the general level of stock, bond, or commodity prices decline, the value of ETFs will decline accordingly.

An investment strategy can be volatile and can involve the loss of some or all of your principal. You understand that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. You understand that KnowVera and the Website are not responsible for any such losses. KnowVera does not promise, guarantee, or imply verbally, or in writing, that any information provided on the Website, will result in a profit.

The commentary and opinions provided by KnowVera and posted on the Website are for general informational purposes only. To the best of our knowledge and belief, all information contained herein is accurate and reliable, and has been obtained from public sources we believe to be accurate and reliable. You understand that any calculations posted on the Website are not guaranteed and may not be complete. All content on the Website is presented only as of the date published or indicated, and may be superseded by subsequent market events or for other reasons. As markets change continuously, previously published information and data may not be current and should not be relied upon. You are responsible for ensuring that you are receiving the most recent data.

None of the information provided replaces your need to independently research any securities that may be referred to on the Website, and you agree to reach your own independent conclusions about any investment decision concerning all securities covered herein. You therefore acknowledge and agree that all investment decisions you may make, including decisions that take into account or rely on any information provided or made available by or from the Website, are yours and yours alone and are made solely at your own risk.

Nothing on the Website should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by KnowVera or any third-party. You alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation. Only you can determine what level of risk is appropriate.

The Website is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice.

Generally, KnowVera and its personnel do not buy, hold or sell positions in the securities discussed on the Website. You acknowledge and agree that certain KnowVera Affiliates may have a position in securities discussed, and that they may trade for their own account. In cases where the position is held at the time of publication, KnowVera, will endeavor to make appropriate disclosures. However, due to the short term nature of the investment and trading activities of such Affiliates, such disclosure may not be possible, or feasible. Therefore, you understand and agree that at the time of any transaction that you make, one or more of KnowVera’s Affiliates may have an undisclosed position in the securities referenced. KnowVera, makes no representations regarding the individual securities positions of any third party service provider.

KnowVera is not compensated in any way for publishing information about securities discussed on its Website other than by user subscription fees.

The commentary provided by KnowVera is based on the proprietary algorithm developed and maintained by KnowVera (the “Algorithm”). The Algorithm pulls in real time market data which enables KnowVera to identify market direction. The Algorithm uses both short and long term time frames, and works across multiple asset classes.
